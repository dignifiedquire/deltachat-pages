**Delta Chat is not only an Android app. You can use it on any device, even
without a smartphone. Since the latest release there are many new features for
the users!**

For many instant messengers you need a phone number, or at least a smartphone -
not for Delta Chat. Even if you don't have a phone, you can use the Desktop
Client on its own.

Most messengers have the problem that you can only chat with others on the same
platform. With Delta Chat, you can write to anyone with an E-Mail address.
This way, you are not locked into the userbase of Whatsapp, Signal, or
Telegram.

## Many New Desktop Client Features!

The Desktop Client is one of the tools which makes this possible! Thanks to the
many developers, testers, translators and contributors who made this release
happen. Here is a quick overview:

- New Keyboard bindings: 
  - press ctrl + K to search for a contact or group chat.
  - move through your chat list with alt + arrow keys.
- There are new beautiful background images by
  [Nico](https://github.com/nicodh) - but you can also choose a custom image.
- Profile pictures make your client more beautiful to look at, too.
- You can now copy a link with a right click on the message.
- There is now also the Saved Messages & Device Chat which you might know from
  [Android](https://delta.chat/en/2019-12-18-google-play-store-release).

## Use Delta Simultaneously with the Android or iOS App!

If you want to synchronize a Desktop Client with an Android or iOS app, better
export a backup and import it on the other device. If you just send an
Autocrypt Setup Message, not everything is transfered. With a backup, you also
get your message history, and verified chats work better.

## Try it out Yourself!

dass appstore releases (windows und mac) ggf im januar angepeilt sind, und man daher noch eine warnung weg klicken muss.
