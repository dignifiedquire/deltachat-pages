**Delta Chat Desktop does not only work well on all platforms now. It also
offers multi-account support, and can be used even without a mobile device. If you use it together
with the appstore releases for Android or iOS, you can get a decent multi-device experience.**

For many other messengers you need a phone number, or at least a mobile device -
but not for Delta Chat. Even if you don't have a phone or tablet, you can use the Desktop
Client on its own.

Additionally, most messengers have the problem that you can only chat with others if they
use the same messenger. With Delta Chat, you can write to anyone with an email address.
This way, you are not locked into the single company-owned userbases of WhatsApp, Signal, or Telegram.

*If you have more than one email address, you can switch between them.*

## Many New Desktop Client Features!

The Desktop Client is one of the tools making this possible! Thanks to the
many developers, testers, translators and contributors who made this release
happen. Here is a quick overview:

- New **Keyboard Shortcuts**: 
  - Press Ctrl + K to search for a contact or group chat.
  - Move through your chat list with Alt + ←↓↑→arrow keys.

- There are new beautiful **background images** by
  [Paula](https://github.com/paulaluap) and [Nico](https://github.com/nicodh) -
  but you can also choose a custom image.

- **Profile pictures** make your client more beautiful to look at, too.

- You can now copy a link by right-clicking the message it is in.

- There is now also the Saved Messages & Device Chat which you might know already 
  from [the mobile apps](https://delta.chat/en/2019-12-18-google-play-store-release).

- The group name will now be used as the subject for outgoing messages. 

- As Desktop also makes it convenient to write "multi-line" messages containing
  several paragraphs, and you can change the "E-mail interaction" setting to 
  consider "All" e-mail, some people successfully experiment with using Delta apps 
  as their only e-mail client.

## Use Delta Simultaneously with the Android or iOS App!

If you want to synchronize a Desktop Client with the Android or iOS Delta Chat app, please 
**export a full backup on one device and import it on the other**.

This way you will get your login credentials, encryption setup, contacts and all chat messages
and media synchronized between two Delta Chat installations. You can export a full backup 
in the settings.  And during Setup of the second device you can, instead of entering login
credentials, import this backup. 

Note that the "Autocrypt Setup Message" is only useful if you want to synchronize your Delta Chat
app with another Autocrypt-supporting mail client. It only allows to transfer the encryption setup but
not any chat or contact history. 

## Installing Delta Chat Desktop 

The Desktop Client will soon be available on the macOS and Windows Appstores; for
now, you need to **download it from [this website](https://get.delta.chat).**

Note that you could be presented with a warning saying Delta Chat is not an official app, because
we don't have official certificates for the appstores yet.

*You can look at all files of a specific conversation in the Media View.*
