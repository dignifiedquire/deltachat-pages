author: compl4xx, holga

You can use the Desktop Client on its own - you don't need a smartphone at all!

Cool new UX features:
- Keyboard bindings
- new background images - but you can also choose a custom image
- Set & change profile pictures
- Copy link with right click on a message
- Device Chat & Saved Messages

## Use Delta Simultaneously with the Android or iOS App!

If you want to synchronize a Desktop Client with an Android or iOS app, better export a backup and import it on the other device.
If you just send an Autocrypt Setup Message, not everything is transfered. With a backup, you also get your message history, and verified chats work better.

enable BCC to self on Android - (should be enabled by default. you can't yet change this on desktop though)

## Try it out Yourself!

dass appstore releases (windows und mac) ggf im januar angepeilt sind, und man daher noch eine warnung weg klicken muss.

You can find the Desktop Client on [get.delta.chat](https://get.delta.chat).
